As part of a technical interview for a data analysis company, I analyzed a track interval training session to identify signs of fatigue throughout the workout. Beyond the data analysis, I conducted a literature review to support my findings and address the main question: does training exclusively on a track improve performance in a 20 km trail race? This project allowed me to combine practical data analysis with scientific research, providing a well-rounded approach to performance evaluation.
